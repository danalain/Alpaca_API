## Retirement Analysis for 30 Years of Cumulative Returns

* __Observation__ : After running 500 Monte Carlo simulations of Cumulative Porfolio Returns for 30 years, there is a 95% chance that an initial investment of $20,000 in the portfolio over the next 30 years will end within in the range of $59,129.7 and $655,390.83. When the initial investment is $30,000, there is a 95% chance that the portfolio over the next 30 years will end within in the range of $88,694.55 and $983,086.25.

## Early Retirement Within 5 years?

* __Method__ : I ran 500 Monte Carlo simulations of Cumulative Porfolio Returns for 5 years with 60 percent in AGG bonds and 40 percent in SPY stocks.

* __Observations 1__ : There is a 95% chance that an initial investment of $20,000 in the portfolio over the next 30 years will end within in the range of $18,902.49 and $38,901.53. There is a posibility that the client may lose $1,079.51.

* __Observations 2__ : With the initial investment of $30,000, there is a 95% chance that the portfolio over the next 5 years will end within in the range of $28,353.73 and $58,352.3.

* __Note__ : If the client prefers to retire at the end of next 5 years, the recommended strategy is to invest $30,000 with 60% AGG and 40% SPY. The reason for investing in 60% of AGG bonds is to hedge the risk of monetary losses as stocks are traditionally more risky than bonds. In case of a bear market, 5 years term will not be long enough to recover from potential losses.

## Early Retirement Within 10 years?

* __Method__ : I ran 500 Monte Carlo simulations of Cumulative Porfolio Returns for 10 years with 50 percent in AGG bonds and 50 percent in SPY stocks.

* __Observations 1__ : There is a 95% chance that an initial investment of $20,000 in the portfolio over the next 10 years will end within in the range of $22,073.85 and $67,219.51  

* __Observations 2__ : When the initial investment is $30,000, there is a 95% chance that the portfolio over the next 10 years will end within in the range of $33,110.77 and $100,829.27. 

* __Note__ :If the client prefers to retire at the end of the next 10 years, the recommended strategy is to invest $30,000 with 50% AGG and 50% SPY.
