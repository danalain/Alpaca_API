However, with the initial investment of $30,000, there is a 95% chance that the portfolio over the next 5 years will end within in the range of $28,353.73 and $58,352.3. If the client prefers to retire at the end of next 5 years, the recommended strategy is to invest $30,000 with 60% AGG and 40% SPY. The reason for investing in 60% of AGG bonds is to hedge the risk of monetary losses as stocks are traditionally more risky than bonds. In case of a bear market, 5 years term will not be long enough to recover from potential losses.
